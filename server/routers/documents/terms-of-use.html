        many offerings supplied by BorrowBe through its website and mobile
        applications is "Services". Regardless of whether you choose to
        register as a user of the Services, your access or utilization of the
        Services, which includes communication with us, signifies your

      <p class="text_p">
        In our business policy, individual users have the privilege of posting
        free ads, subject to the specific category's criteria. Once the free
        limit is reached, users have the option to either pause or delete
        existing active ads, or opt to pay accordingly. Business users, on the
        other hand, do not have access to free listing options by default,
        unless there is an ongoing promotion or offer. Furthermore, both
        individual and business users can explore promotion and extra feature
        packages, which come with additional pricing, to enhance their
        listings on our platform. These packages offer enhanced visibility and
        features, empowering users to maximize the impact of their listings
        and expand their reach to a wider audience.

      </p>
      <p class="text_p">
        The payment for listing fees must be made in advance (prepaid) and is
        non-refundable. However, in instances where users encounter challenges
        such as accidental double payments, incorrect payments, or unforeseen
        circumstances, they can still opt to submit a refund request. Our
        BorrowBe agents thoroughly evaluate each request, determining its
        legitimacy, and process refunds when deemed appropriate. It's
        important to note that BorrowBe agents reserve the right to decline a
        refund if necessary.
      </p>
      <p class="text_p">
        The processing of payments will be carried out by a third-party
        service provider, subject to the exclusive discretion of BorrowBe.
      </p>

      <p class="text_p">
        BorrowBe reserves the right to change the fee structure at any time at
        its sole discretion without any obligation of intimation to the users.
      </p>

      <p class="text_p">
        Any fees paid for the listings will remain in effect for the term it
        was opted for and will not accrue any additional charge for the
        existing listing if the fee structure is amended by BorrowBe.
      </p>

      <p class="text_p">
        BorrowBe recommends the users refer to the current pricing structure

      </p>
      <h3 class="text_h3 text_underline">Article 12 - LISTING DURATION</h3>
      <p class="text_p">
        Listings will remain active for a specified duration of thirty days
        unless earlier deleted or manually unlisted by the user. Deleted items
        are not eligible for relisting; however, items that have been paused
        may be resumed within their original listing period.
      </p>

      <h3 class="text_h3 text_underline">Article 13 - LISTING EXPIRY</h3>
      <p class="text_p">
        The standard duration for a listing is set to terminate after 30 days.
        Should the user opt to extend the listing, they may do so by
        re-listing the ad before its expiry. The extended duration will be in
        accordance with the terms agreed upon at the time of re-listing.
      </p>
      <p class="text_p">
        The expiry of any additional features or services selected (add-ons)
        is dependent on the specific package chosen at the time of the ad
        listing.
      </p>
      <p class="text_p">
        Ad listings may be paused and resumed by the user within the thirty
        day period. When a listing is paused, it is removed from public view
        but the duration of the listing continues to elapse. As such, if a
        listing is paused mid-term, the countdown toward its expiry will
        proceed unaffected. Users retain access to their existing chats until
        the advertisement is either permanently removed or all conversations
        are terminated. Resuming a listing will make it visible again for
        public viewing.
      </p>
      <h3 class="text_h3 text_underline">Article 14 - TERMINATION</h3>
      <p class="text_p">
        To the extent permitted by applicable law, you may stop using the
        Services at any time, and the users shall have the ability to remove
        their listings at their discretion and restrict chat interactions with
        fellow users.
      </p>
      <p class="text_p">
        For any reason, or for no reason at all, BorrowBe reserves the right
        to terminate your account and remove any listings. A Party may
        discontinue its use of the Services, but this will not release it from
        any ongoing obligations. Any information you may have previously
        provided to BorrowBe, including but not limited to photos and other
        data, may be retained and used by BorrowBe. Any termination of the
        Agreement will not impact in any manner the disclaimers, waivers,
        liability limitations, and sections pertaining to legal matters under
        the Agreement.
