            When a User communicates with BorrowBe via phone, email, text

            data. Regarding the 'Pause' functionality: Activating this feature
            only removes a listing from public visibility but does not interrupt
            the duration of the listing period. Therefore, if a listing is
            paused, its expiration will adhere to the initially established end
            date.

            BorrowBe gathers information about how long people use the app, what

          <p class="text_p">
            When certain features of the application are utilized, BorrowBe
            gathers location information. When you download and use the app, we
            ask for location permissions. To provide you with the best
            experience possible, our app requires your location settings to be
            turned "on". We collect precise and/or approximate location data
            from Users, including postal code, province, town, city, street, and
            exact locations. For an optimal experience, precise location
            information is provided. The User has the option to turn off their
